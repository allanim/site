My professional interests include E-commerce, Payment system, Java framework, build & operations, agile development, and continuous integration.

I currently study English language and mobile applications in Toronto. Previously, I was a developer at UZEN in Japan and have been lucky to be a part of a few fantastic teams spanning research on software development methodologies, design and development of E-commerce in Japan, and R&D for payment, delivery, language, country, currency, etc. for Global Deployment of E-commerce.

Recently, my work has developed [G1Commerce](http://g1commerce.jp/) and [PARCO](http://www.anrealage.com/)([press](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000018.000011185.html))
