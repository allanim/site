My professional interests include business strategy and operations, the quantified self, tech, design thinking, startups, and sustainable development.

I currently lead Operations at Driver, a startup based in San Francisco connecting cancer patients to treatment options. Previously, I was a consultant at McKinsey & Company and have been lucky to be a part of a few fantastic teams spanning operations and content for startups in New York and San Francisco, social innovation and strategy consulting in London, and sustainability research as a Global Fellow for Sustainable Development in the Dominican Republic.

Recently, my work has appeared on Inc. Magazine, Mashable, Lifehacker, Business Insider, Women 2.0, and The Daily Muse.
