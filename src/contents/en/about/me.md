Hi, I'm Allan.

Alumnus of [Chonbuk national university](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chonbuk_National_University) in korea.

Intrigued by programing, design, strategy, traveling, photography, calm music, fantasy movie, video game, puzzle, art, fabulous food, and even better conversations.

Seeking to be inspired, to positive thinking, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.
