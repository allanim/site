こんにちは、イムソンヨプと申します。

Toronto via Tokyo, Seoul, and Jeonju. Alumnus of Jeonbuk national University.

Intrigued by design, traveling, photography, classical music, strategy, writing, art, armchair philosophy, fabulous food, and even better conversations.

Seeking to be inspired, to envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by those who bring out the best in me.
